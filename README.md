## 📊 Dataset

We used the [CIC-IoT2023 Dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/iot2023.html) which contains both benign and malicious IoT traffic. The dataset includes attacks like DDoS, Injection, Reconnaissance, etc.

Due to size limitations, the raw CSV files are not included in this repository. Please download them manually from the [official source](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/iot2023.html) and place them in the `data/` directory.
